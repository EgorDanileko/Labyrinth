# Labyrinth
This C# program creates a console-based game that simulates navigating through a labyrinth. 
In this labyrinth, you control a character represented by the letter "X" and attempt to reach the exit.
The labyrinth is represented as a 2D grid of characters where the "." character represents empty spaces, 
and your character "X" represents your current position.
To play the game, use the WASD keys to navigate your character "X" through the labyrinth and try to reach the exit.
Press "R" at any time to exit the game.
